# utilizing_data_in_EMRs

Course Description
The scientific utility of EHR derived “routine” clinical data generated as a byproduct of care delivery has been previously demonstrated, and there are no insurmountable technical challenges or barriers to achieving the effective use of this type of data for a national cohort of millions of individuals.

This course is designed to introduce students to one of the major components of data collection, analysis and clinical decision support systems at the point of care: The electronic health record systems (EHR) and their use in care management, research, and analytics. The course is intended to familiarize students with data access across multiple data sources. This is a practical, hands on experience course that will introduce students to the variety of systems used in the clinic and the complex interactions and features that make up a modern clinical information system.

This is an introduction‐level course, designed to offer the most benefit to Health Data Scientists and offers a deep learning experience of EHR functionality. Students will learn different aspects of EHR systems in both inpatient and outpatient clinical environments, and will focus on data extraction, exploring analytics and visualization capabilities and generating insights from the perspective of EHR. To achieve this we teach in two parallel paths, eventually merging at the end of the course in a final project. One path covers the EHR itself, its history, construction and the technical process of modifying an EHR to gather different forms of data. In the second path we explore how this data is extracted, transformed, stored and analyzed, with a focus on real world skills. For their final group projects students will be expected to modify their own EHR, demonstrate the changes in data gather, and execute an analysis.

Course Learning Objectives

Understand from a practical perspective how EHRs are organized and configured
Understand EHR functionality in the context of clinical workflows and processes
Engage in "hands on" learning in an environment that closely simulates a real‐world clinical informatics setting
Retrieve patient medical records for physicians, researchers, or other scientist.
Interact with an EHR in a manner that improves their understanding of system functionality
Plan, develop, maintain, or operate a variety of health record indexes or storage and retrieval systems to collect, classify, store, or analyze information.
Compile and maintain patients' medical records to document condition and treatment and to provide data for research or cost control and care improvement efforts.

Pre-requisites
A working knowledge of R, Python and SQL. All HIDS students are highly encouraged to complete the self-directed bootcamp to ensure they are at an intermediate level in R, Python and SQL.
