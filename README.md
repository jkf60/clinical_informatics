# Clinical Informatics and EHR Systems

Overview

This repository contains the final project for the HIDS502 course, focusing on Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems in clinical settings. The final project is a practical application of EHR systems for care management, research, and analytics. Other files include advanced coursework using SQL to perform different tasks and objectives. 

This course covers the use of EHRs in healthcare, focusing on data collection, analysis, and clinical decision support systems. Students learn about data access across multiple sources, with hands-on experience in various clinical information systems.

Learning Objectives

1. Understanding EHR configuration and organization.
2. Engaging in real-world clinical informatics settings.
3. Retrieving medical records and improving EHR system functionality.
4. Developing health record indexes, storage, and retrieval systems.
5. Final Project 

Final Project 

Title: "Prevention of Emergency Department Hospital Admissions in Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) Patients through Routine Nutritionist Counseling: A Pilot Quality Improvement Program"

The project involves identifying CHF patients at risk of hospital readmission and implementing a pilot program for routine dietary counseling. The analysis includes:

1. Identifying patients with CHF from EHR data.
2. Analyzing patient body weight changes as a marker for CHF exacerbation.
3. Proposing a nutrition counseling referral for patients with significant weight changes.

Key Results and Figures

Patient Population Analysis: Identified a total of 847 CHF patients, with 222 experiencing significant body weight changes.
Data Visualization: Tables and graphs depicting patient demographics, weight changes, and other relevant clinical markers.
Quality Improvement Strategy: Outline of the proposed nutrition counseling referral process.

Prerequisites
Knowledge in R, Python, and SQL.

Conclusion

This repository serves as an educational resource for Health Data Scientists and students in Health Informatics, demonstrating the practical application of EHR systems for improved patient care and decision-making.
